Hardware:
Connect 2 diodes to output pins, one in each direction (tests the change in direction)

Software:
initialise the pins and variables

Libraries:
serial

functions:
- left_to_right
        - first h_bridge config in pin configurations
- right_to_left
        - second h-bridge confit in pin configurations
- safety (in pin_config use emergency shutoff)
        - check if should turn off?
        - switch all off accordingly



loop
- safety
- Turn on left-to-right
- safety
wait 1 second
- turn on right-to-left
- safety

--> edit: safety has to be in the loop



recursion in the loop, i.e:
run LR,
turn the mosfets on,
check for overcurrent.
If so, run safety loop
turn
